A collection of sample Python code shared while learning more about vision
analysis and object tracking with the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library.

Validation
-----------

 - validate-step-1.py :: once you've installed OpenCV's python client library,
   run this script to see if you can use it. It displays an odd picture in grayscale.

 - validate-step-2.py :: connect your camera to the USB port 0 (or edit the
   source to specify another point number...like 1), and see if you can view
   your camera image, again in grayscale.

Camera Calibration
--------------------

 - show-corners.py :: displays three checkerboard images in succession where the
   corners have been identified and displayed with rainbowic colors.
